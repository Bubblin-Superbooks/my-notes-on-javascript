This guide will give you advice on how to start doing things quickly with JavaScript. First, we’ll talk about the mindsets and the approaches that will help you stay on track and avoid wasting time. Next, we’ll look at a short list of concepts that will let you do a large number of practical things with JavaScript. Finally, we’ll look at jobrelated tips and how JavaScript fits into your path as a front-end web developer. How to stop feeling lost and overwhelmed by all the frameworks that are out there § First, block out all the noise. People will make it sound like you need to know everything, but that's not true. It just seems that way because everyone chimes in with their own suggestions, and that adds up. The best way to avoid this is to have a clear map of what to do. Here's a map of what to do to become a front-end web developer: https://simplestepscode.com/pdf/simple_steps_roadmap.pdf - 4 - SimpleStepsCode.com § Don't constantly chase the new framework of the day. Instead, practice plain JavaScript, and you'll automatically get better at a lot of the frameworks because so many of them are just prebuilt pieces of JavaScript. When the time comes to start aiming for jobs, you'll quickly pick up whichever framework is required for the jobs you want most. Simple tricks so you won't forget everything you learned § Learn in small pieces. Not only will you remember things better, you'll also have an easier experience finding time to code. It can be tempting to learn a lot at once, but try to resist that. Trust me; you'd rather learn one thing at a time and remember it than learn ten things at a time and forget all of them. § When you understand a concept, DON'T move forward just yet. Keep playing with the concept until you're very comfortable with it. It will seem to take a little bit longer at - 5 - SimpleStepsCode.com first, but you'll fly through the later material because you won't have to keep struggling and backtracking with earlier material. This technique is great for keeping momentum and staying encouraged. § When you're learning JavaScript, let yourself have fun with it. If you've learned a new concept, create something interesting, even if it's something small! Experiment, show your friends, show the internet, or keep it all to yourself. As long as you make sure to enjoy yourself, you'll have a much easier time learning JavaScript. How to avoid the mistakes that keep people stuck § One mistake people make is to follow a tutorial and then never actually try building something on their own. Tutorials are great, but it's important to remember that they are only a starting point. Too many people follow a tutorial, think they know how to do it, and then get stuck when they have to apply it for real. The way around this is to try a concept completely - 6 - SimpleStepsCode.com on your own after you've finished a tutorial. That way, you'll learn the process of thinking through a problem yourself instead of depending on a guide. § Another mistake people make is to jump into huge projects too soon. They'll say things like "I'll just make a quick slideshow," without realizing that the slideshow actually involves functions, variables, timing, animation, arrays, DOM traversal, and more. In this case, the impatience of wanting to do all of this at once ends up taking longer than it would take to just learn each concept properly first. The solution is to learn things one small step at a time. Which JavaScript concepts will let you do practical things the fastest? Here's a list of concepts to look up and try out in order to do practical things with JavaScript quickly: § variables - Variables let you store information so you don't have to keep typing it - 7 - SimpleStepsCode.com § getElementById - This lets you access things by their ids on your page. § innerHTML - This lets you edit the HTML inside an element on your page. § functions - A function is a piece of code that you can run whenever you want just by calling its name. § if and else – If and else statements let you put logic into your code. (Example: If X is true, do Y.) § onclick - This lets you detect clicks so your pages can respond however you want. § style and className - These let you dynamically change the appearance, position, and visibility of the things on your pages. § arrays and objects - These let you store lists and groups of information in a convenient way. § querySelector and querySelectorAll - These are flexible ways to manipulate the things on your page. - 8 - SimpleStepsCode.com How to shortcut the job hunt, and what you need to know § Just submitting resumes is the hardest way to get a job. That's what everyone else is doing, and that's why they're having a hard time. § Job requirements are notoriously inaccurate. I've seen posts for front-end developers that required exclusively back-end skills. I've seen posts with requirements that turned out to be nothing like the actual job. § The best thing to do is find developers to talk to. Even if their organizations aren't hiring, you can ask questions that will help you appeal to other organizations. They might even be able to point you to places that are hiring. The key is to keep your questions focused on what they do rather than asking for a job. That way, they'll open up to you, and it won't be weird. § To find developers to talk to, one way to start is with a Google search for "web development meetups in [your area]". If there isn't anything near your area, then try talking to developers - 9 - SimpleStepsCode.com online whether it's through LinkedIn, meetup.com, various forums or groups, etc. § When you talk to developers, you'll want to ask the right questions to really figure out what they do, what would make a good teammate, and what surprises to expect. This is one of the most important steps, so a full guide can be found here: https://simplestepscode.com/how-to-get-a-webdevelopment-job-in-four-steps/ § In the meantime, start creating a portfolio. If you have good things you've built that you can point to, then you don't need to worry as much about fancy measures of experience. When you have concrete things you've made, no one can argue with that. It's also a great way to practice. How your JavaScript will fit into your overall path in front-end web development § HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the main things you need to know for web development. Don't worry about frameworks until you've identified which ones you see at the places you want to work at. The great part about JavaScript is that getting - 10 - SimpleStepsCode.com better at it automatically makes you better at a lot of the frameworks because many of them are built on JavaScript. §

Before you start on the path to becoming a front-end web developer, here are some things you should know. How to not be overwhelmed The internet is full of people saying you need to learn every language, framework, and tool in order to be a front-end web developer. The advice is well-intentioned but damaging because it can be so overwhelming that you don’t know where to begin, so you never begin. What you need is to focus on one thing at a time and not get distracted worrying about everything else. The aim of this guide is to give you a step-by-step idea of what to do in order to become a front-end web developer. - 4 - SimpleStepsCode.com How to find time to learn Don’t worry about setting aside a bunch of time to learn. Just set aside 2 minutes, and if you’re having fun, you’ll go way over that. That’s how sites like Facebook and YouTube get people to stay on there for hours. How to learn efficiently You learn the fastest by actually typing code. Seriously. 15 minutes of coding can often be more effective than hours of reading. Reading is important too, but it should never be a substitute for actually coding. - 5 - SimpleStepsCode.com Becoming a front-end web developer Learn HTML: Put stuff on a web page  Get a text-editor that you like (I like Sublime Text (it’s a free download), but feel free to use whatever you want)  Create a basic web page with some text  Put other stuff on your page: headers, paragraphs, links, divs Learn CSS: Style a web page  Style the stuff on your page (colors, backgrounds, sizes, fonts, positioning, layout, etc)  Learn the CSS box model to understand how CSS lays stuff out  Learn about classes, ids, and selectors in order to make it easier to identify and style stuff on your pages  While you’re learning CSS, take the time to try out other features of HTML like lists and forms for example - 6 - SimpleStepsCode.com  Learn how to make your pages responsive so they work on mobile as well as desktop Learn JavaScript: Make your web pages more interactive  Get comfortable with some of the basics: variables, functions, arrays, objects, loops, and events.  Get comfortable manipulating the pieces of your page with JavaScript (examples: add two numbers and show the result on the page, show a lightbox when the user clicks a button, etc.)  Understand how jQuery works (it’s such a common library that you’re bound to run into it, but if you know JavaScript, then you can pick up the basics of jQuery in an afternoon) Pick up good coding habits as you go  Make sure your code is clean, organized, well-commented, and easy to maintain.  Don’t bloat your pages with unnecessary plugins. - 7 - SimpleStepsCode.com  Learn to make your pages load fast (a guide can be found here when you’re ready: http://simplestepscode.com/make-yourwebsite-load-faster/ ) Start creating a body of work you can show  Codepen is a good place for small demos  Additionally, you can host your own portfolio (a Google search for free hosting should give you some options) Next steps: Career stuff  Once you’re comfortable with the fundamentals, it’s time to choose what to do.  If you want the freelance route, then learn about WordPress and hosting.  If you want the job route, talk to developers, figure out the types of places you’d like to work, and then learn what tools they use there (examples: version control, frameworks, etc).
